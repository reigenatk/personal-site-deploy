I've been playing them for a long time.\r\n              I left multiplayer games out because <span className=\"lb\">everyone knows those.</span> The ones I (used to play) the most are\r\n              League, Osu, agar.io when I was a middle schooler and Club Penguin when I was a kid 🙃)\r\n              So with that in mind, I tried to keep the list below to singleplayer games.\r\n            \r\n              <br />\r\n              <br />\r\n              Oh and on another note- my favorite kinds of games are <span className=\"lr\">open world</span> and\r\n              <span className=\"lb\"> indie/RPG</span> story driven games,\r\n              open world cuz muh graphics, and the latter because I think indie games often can tell such elaborate \r\n              stories and create amazing atmospheres for the player. Kinda like a mass-produced donut vs. a home-made one. \r\n              <br></br>\r\n              <br></br>\r\n              Also, lots of really good indie games were\r\n              made by only one person, or a small team, so they really put their heart into it.\r\n              <br></br>\r\n              <br></br>\r\n              Unrelated: I just now realized that I unintentionally included three games where the main character is a cat...
